# Taskify for Gtk#

This is Taskify implemented using the GTK, hence cross platform compatible. This is really specifically for a Linux user interface as WPF/UWP exist for Windows an Xamarin.Mac for the Mac.

_Note: At the time of writing no further work will be going into this as Taskify for Linux is being implemented using Avalonia which seems a better fit to reuse existing code._
